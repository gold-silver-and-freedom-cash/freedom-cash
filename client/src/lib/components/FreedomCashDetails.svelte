	>Freedom Enterprise</a
> and many more Freedom Projects.
<p><br /></p>
<!-- Freedom Cash supports peer to peer collaboration while preventing pump and dump frauds. <br> -->
Freedom Cash provides a buy and sell function within the smart contract itself, defining a reasonable
pricing algorithm and ensuring that people do not waste gas-, liquidity provider- and exchange fees.

<h4 class="text-center">Liquidity</h4>
The total supply of Freedom Cash was minted not to the developer or deployer but to the
<a href="{baseURLScan}token/{smartContractAddress}#code#L891" target="_blank"> smart contract</a>
itself.

<h4>Questions & Answers</h4>

<p><br /></p>
<h6>
	Why don't you create liquidity as an ETH/FreedomCash Tradingpair on Uniswap? <br />
</h6>
<p><br /></p>
With our approach we reduce gas fees and avoid pool fees for
<a href="{baseURLScan}token/{smartContractAddress}#code#L891" target="_blank">Freedom Cash</a>
investors.
<p><br /></p>
Additionally our pricing approach protects against ponzi like vulnerabilities & drops of the sell price.
<p><br /><br /></p>
<h6>What happens if anyone creates a liquidity pool for Freedom Cash on Uniswap?</h6>

<br /> People are free to create liquidity pools e.g. with ETH/FreedomCash liquidity on Uniswap.
It's just not necessary and not useful.
<p><br /><br /></p>
<h6>
	How is it possible that the sell price never drops? <br />
</h6>
<p><br /></p>
The sell price of Freedom Cash expressed in Ether can stay as it is or go up. It can never drop.

	This seems too good to be true. What's the catch? <br />
</h6>
<p><br /></p>
It might take a while until people realize that the sell price is at all times the minimum sell price
which will never go below the current value expressed in Ether - even in a "bankrun" like situation.
