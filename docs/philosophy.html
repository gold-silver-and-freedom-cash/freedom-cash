	Please think for yourself about the following while you go for a walk offline: The crimes of the &quot;governments&quot;
	you worked for, seem much more dangerous to humanity than the crimes which abuse freedom and privacy
	of money. We believe in peace over war. We believe in freedom over totalitarianism. We believe in reasonable
	good police officers over kyc and total surveillance. We believe in free humans. You have proved that
	all your kyc, censorship, propaganda and visions of totalitarian state money called CBDC do not succeed.
	Even if you do not fully understand how we solve things yet, even if you do not like us, even if you
	cannot feel the hearts of free humans in your heart, we invite you to join us, learn with us, help
	us and enjoy also the technical pulses of freedom block by block by block by block by block by block
	by block by block by block

	<h4 class="text-center" data-svelte-h="svelte-1u4qubn">Our Message To Mass Media People</h4>
	We know it is tough for some of you to earn a living and even harder to become free. We encourage you
	to foster your interest for real, free and brave journalism again. Why do you accept that the best
	of your colleagues are in prison? We believe you can do better than that. We invite you to invest and
	talk about Freedom Cash. Please stop spreading divide and conquer propaganda. Feel free to join us.

	<h4 class="text-center" data-svelte-h="svelte-14vjqrr">Our Message To Politicians</h4>
	Please relax, go for a walk and decide wisely if you would like to be a part of the problem or a part
	of the solution.<br>
	Many of you might be victims of their own former &quot;success&quot; causing you to think and feel in old divide
	and conquer propaganda patterns. What you perceived as success at that time might turn out to be rather
	the opposite. <br>
	It seems some of you tried to prevent honorable, fair, respectful people from being free.<br>
	This seems not very nice of you. <br>
	Please stop trying to divide and conquer. Please stop trying to make people angry at each other.
	<br>
	Please do not try to associate us with any group of people which you prepared to be disliked by your
	mainstream believers. <br>
	Please do not infiltrate our Freedom Lover community with your bad actors. <br>
	Maybe no one told you in your life: Please treat everyone as you would like to be treated yourself.
	<br>

	We will need to finance with taxes only those of you who actually represent our free will.
	<br>
	If you do not like to represent the free will of free, reasonable people, you might reconsider your
	career decisions. <br>
	If you are interested in freedom, fairness love and peace and with that in our everyone&#39;s wellbeing,
	please join us and help us to pave the way into <br> <a href="https://otherparty.co.uk" target="_blank" data-svelte-h="svelte-3a6qsl">real democracy</a>.

	If we do not own freedom, what do we own?<br>
	It seems to be a good idea to own freedom again and to support people who encourage <br> <a href="https://otherparty.co.uk" target="_blank" data-svelte-h="svelte-3a6qsl">real democracy</a>.
	<p data-svelte-h="svelte-pntvnr"><br></p>
	Totalitarian Internationalsocialism disguised as democracy is about to come to an end anyways.<br> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-pntvnr"><br></p>

	We are not left or right.<br>
	We are humans.
	<p data-svelte-h="svelte-pntvnr"><br></p>
	We do not divide and conquer.<br>
	We love and invite.
	<p data-svelte-h="svelte-pntvnr"><br></p>
	We are not good or bad.<br>
	We are as good as we can.
	<p data-svelte-h="svelte-pntvnr"><br></p>
	We are not rich or poor.<br>
	We are as rich as we deserve to be by being fair.
	<p data-svelte-h="svelte-pntvnr"><br></p>
	We are not nationalists or international socialists.<br>
	We support freedom for everyone who supports freedom for everyone.
	<p data-svelte-h="svelte-pntvnr"><br></p>
	We do not exclude anyone who treats everyone with fairness and respect.<br>
	We invite everyone to join us early.
	<p data-svelte-h="svelte-pntvnr"><br></p> <h4 data-svelte-h="svelte-rcsoft">Potential Weak Spots</h4>
	Weak spots of our endeavors in freedom, fairness, love and peace seem to be:<br>
	We do not know if corrupt central actors might still have a chance in launching a 51 percent attack
	on the Ethereum Blockchain. <br>
	They also might try to criminalize owners of own money. They were stupid and or corrupt enough to ignore
	that
	<b data-svelte-h="svelte-1vvdl0">Privacy is Not a Crime</b> when they tried to censor privacy transactions on the Ethereum
	blockchain like those interacting with privacy protocols like Tornado Cash. International
	socialists might learn that Privacy is Not a Crime, Journalism is Not a Crime and
	<b data-svelte-h="svelte-1f6uspe">Freedom is Not a Crime</b>.
	<p data-svelte-h="svelte-pntvnr"><br></p>

	If corrupt international socialists try to criminalize some of us for owning our own money by
	making up any crime stories like they probably did with Andrew Tate, we hope that there will be
	outrages like those which will lead to the release of brave journalists like Julian Assange. So
	the weakest weak spot migh be a huge amount of potentially ignorant people who rather hide behind
	their &quot;weakness&quot; instead of investing into freedom.
	<p data-svelte-h="svelte-pntvnr"><br></p> <h4 class="text-center" data-svelte-h="svelte-199ahx7">Our Wish</h4>
	May everyone who reads this with the best of intentions always have enough Freedom Cash stored within
	self hosted paperwallets which shall be utilized for fruitful, respectful and fair exploration of truth
	and peer to peer collaboration. Please make Freedom Cash an homage to all who play for freedom and
	invest some Finney right now. Start small and talk about Freedom. We wish you all the best.
	<p data-svelte-h="svelte-pntvnr"><br></p> <h4 data-svelte-h="svelte-160ysa2">Contact</h4> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-pntvnr"><br></p>
	We do not believe in centralized responsibles. Therefore we do not recommend specific people as contact
	persons.
	<p data-svelte-h="svelte-pntvnr"><br></p>
	In this respect the smart contract is your point of smart contact. Read it.
	<p data-svelte-h="svelte-pntvnr"><br></p>
	Please avoid interacting with scammers and impersonators. Everyone might be in The A-Team.
	<p data-svelte-h="svelte-pntvnr"><br></p>
	This is a community project which shall empower people. With power comes responsibility. Please understand
	that you are alone responsible for your private keys and for making sure that you interact with the
	correct smart contract and that you understand the smart contract. You alone are responsible for all
	of your actions. This dApp page is associated with timestamp: 1706470643017.

so that you can explain it to your friends if you like it. <p data-svelte-h="svelte-pntvnr"><br></p>
	Please educate yourself.
