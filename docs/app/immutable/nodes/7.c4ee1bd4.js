	Paperwallets help to make crypto cypherpunk again.

	Just like we use a browser to browse the internet, we use a wallet to interact with blockchains.
	<p><br/></p>

	For small amounts and in order to interact with blockchains via dApps, we utilize online wallets
	like
	<a href="https://metamask.io" target="_blank">metamask.io</a>
	and
	<a href="https://sonsofcrypto.com/" target="_blank">sonsofcrypto</a>.
	<p><br/></p>
	For big amounts of money and in order to collaborate peer to peer without corrupt and totalitarian
	surveillance people in between we prefer offline wallets like paperwallets etc.
	<p><br/><br/></p> <h6>Offline Wallets</h6> <p><br/></p>
	One of the best ways to store your crypto assets are self hosted (only you have the private key), cold
	(not connected to the internet) wallets.
